# OHDSI2RDF

### Fully connecting the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative with the world of linked open data

![sample](http://www.jmbanda.com/sample_tripple.png)

Leveraging [Ananke](https://github.com/thepanacealab/OHDSIananke), the utility here converts [Athena](http://athena.ohdsi.org/) vocbulary files into one large Turtle file containing the vocabulary converted to an RDF graph.

This work was conceptualized for/and (mostly) carried out while at the [Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 5](http://blah5.linkedannotation.org/) in Kashiwa, Japan.
