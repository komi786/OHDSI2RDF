Leveraging [Ananke](https://github.com/thepanacealab/OHDSIananke), the utility here converts [Athena](http://athena.ohdsi.org/) vocbulary files into one large Turtle file containing the vocabulary converted to an RDF graph.


This work was conceptualized for/and (mostly) carried out while at the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 5 in Kashia, Japan.
